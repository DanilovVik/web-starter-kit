## Install

Instruction for installation WSK please read in `master` branch [README.md](https://github.com/justcoded/web-starter-kit/blob/master/README.md#install)


## Commands

There are few commands available to help you build and test sites:


### Watch For Changes & Automatically Refresh Across Devices

```sh
$ gulp
```

This includes linting as well as script, stylesheet and HTML compiling.
Also, a [browsersync](https://browsersync.io/) script will be automatically generated, which will take care of precaching your sites resources.


### Serve the Fully Built & Optimized Site

```sh
$ gulp build
```

Command for building current project, ready for WordPress.
This includes linting as well as script, stylesheet and HTML compiling.


## Structure

Your folder structure for WSK:

```

In `package.json` you can find all the dependencies.
In `assets` folder (`web-starter-kit` after renaming) you can find all sources for the project.
In `public` folder (created after running `gulp`) you will find compiled files of styles and js.
And in `public` folder you will put your custom folders with sources (like - images, fonts, videos, audios).

Use `assets/js/modules` to add your javascript modules (don't forget to include it in app.js), `assets/scss` folder to add your styles for the project. You can create, delete files and folders in `assets/scss`, but don't forget to include them in `assets/scss/styles.scss` file.

Use `assets/vendor_entries` to include plugins into your project.

## JS

 In our WSK you can use ES6+. ES6+ isn't introducing anything other than improvements to the JavaScript language and a few new features.

 It is not an alternative syntax or language like CoffeeScript or TypeScript. It's good ol' fashioned JavaScript. The reason so many people are excited is that this version introduces a lot of much-needed improvements to the language.

* All custom **javascript** files are located in `js/` folder;
* Entry point for javascript is `assets/js/app.js` you can **import** all your *.js* files from here using [ES6 import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) feature;
* All javascript is **babelified** so yes! You can use all kind of [ES6 features](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/) here.
* All **extensions** must be installed by the [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install);
* After installing the extension you must **include its files**:
  * **js files** must be included in `assets/vendor_entries/vendor.js` by adding new elements to the **array**.



## SCSS

In our WSK you can use [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.

Sass is a CSS preprocessor — a layer between the stylesheets you author and the .css files you serve to the browser. Sass (short for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) plugs the holes in CSS as a language, allowing you to write DRY code that’ll be faster, more efficient, and easier to maintain. In our WSK we follow Sass [guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture).

So while normal CSS doesn’t yet allow things like variables, mixins (reusable blocks of styles), and other goodies, Sass provides a syntax that does all of that and more—enabling “super functionality” in addition to your normal CSS.

* All custom **scss** files locate in `assets/scss/` folder;
* Entry point for all scss is `assets/scss/styles.scss` you can **import** all your *.scss* files from here;
* You **don't need** to write **prefixes** for different browsers like `-webkit` it will be done by the gulp.

The `assets` directory above contains MDL's Sass files and the JavaScript sources for all MDL components.

* All **extensions** must be installed by the [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install);
* After installing the extension you must **include its files**:
  * **css or sass files** must be included in `assets/vendor_entries/vendor.scss` using `@import`.

You are able to add your own custom sass files and optionally [disable/enable gulp-group-css-media-queries module](https://github.com/justcoded/web-starter-kit/issues/56).
You can see this property in the gulp-config.js file:

Please don't forget to link all your custom scss files in html:

Also, you might want to add these sass files to the ignore list (check `getPathesToCopyForProduction` and `getPathesToCopy` properties in the `gulp-config.js` file). By default they will be copied to the `public/css` without grouping css media queries.
